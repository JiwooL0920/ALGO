items are not stored next to each other in memory - no random indexing 
finding arbitary item - O(N)
inserting items at the beginning - O(1)
remove item from the beginning - O(1) 
insert at the end - O(N)

dynamic data structure -- can acquire memory at run time 
need more memory because of references
no random access -- we can only access first node 
can't go back a node
